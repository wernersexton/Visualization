What do we want to have for the viewer to explore?
Without worrying excessively about design, we'll create a
reasonably rich page/dashboard for the viewer to explore
the SF Bay housing price data.

UI

 plot of the map of the bay area with counties.
 Color code by price or number of houses sold.
   Ideally get the boundaries for the cities and use those rather than counties.
   Allow the viewer to change what we color by - median price or number of houses sold.

 Display density plots for price by city

 Display number of houses by week by county or city
   Allow the viewer to change the start and end dates.

 Plot of price by sqft for the included points.  
    Tooltips

 Click on a point in a plot and see the corresponding entry from Zillow.

 Two scatter plots - click/mouse over point in one, see the points in the other.

 Checkboxes to add/remove counties/cities from the plots
